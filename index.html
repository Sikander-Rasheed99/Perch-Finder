                        <p>When working with homebuyers to find their perfect house, a nagging question typically
                           is: Are
                           big data platforms the “way”, or is it really about creating and building relationships?
                           And
                           what about working with decision makers and others in the home buying journey? Trying to
                           communicate and work effectively with multiple people, multiple opinions, and too many
                           mobile
                           apps is time consuming and frustrating.
                        </p>
                        <p>PerchFinder enables you to connect with the primary decision maker and others in one,

                           organization, and context.

                        <p>You want to build trust and stay connected to your client. But what is the best way? Text
                           messages, emails, voicemails, social media, direct messages, making connection more
                           complex than
                           ever.

                     <p>When working with homebuyers to find their perfect house, a nagging question typically is:
                        Are
                        big data platforms the “way”, or is it really about creating and building relationships? And
                        what about working with decision makers and others in the home buying journey? Trying to
                        communicate and work effectively with multiple people, multiple opinions, and too many
                        mobile
                        apps is time consuming and frustrating.

                     <p>To sell the best home to your client, you need to discover what your client likes, needs and
                        wants in a home. Maybe you use a form, perhaps an interview, maybe some questions over texts
                        messages, or social media direct messages. And what about other decision makers, family and
                        maybe even friends that your buyer wants to include in their home purchase?

                        <p>Big data brands want homebuyers to use their platforms to search and then “pick a
                           Realtor” for the transaction. Professional Realtors want to network, create top-of-mind
                           awareness in their circles so that homebuyers come to them first. When working with
                           homebuyers to find their perfect house, a nagging question typically is: Are big data
                           platforms the “way”, or is it really about creating and building relationships? And what

                           Working with your homebuyer can be challenging, especially when there seems to be a
                           million different ways to do it. Between text messages, emails, voicemails, social
                           media, direct messages and more making collaboration extra complex.
